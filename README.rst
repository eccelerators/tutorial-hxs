Comprehensive Tutorial to HxS: The Tool for Designing Hardware/Software Interfaces
==================================================================================

Foreword
--------

HxS, unlike other tools, uniquely designs hardware/software interfaces rather than merely describing them.
Launched in 2009 by a dedicated developer community, HxS utilized XML, guided by an XSD schema, to capture user ideas, and employed XSLT transformations to produce outputs for target domains such as VHDL, C, and WORD.
Until 2011, HxS powered over a hundred FPGA designs and has been continuously developed, enhanced, and validated in response to real-time developer needs.
HxS dramatically reduced the development effort by over 30% and accelerated time to market, thanks to improved quality and robust adaptability to requirement changes.

In the middle of 2011, the introduction of Xtext 2.0 by the Eclipse Foundation, Itemis AG, and TypeFox marked a significant turning point for the HxS XML user frontend. 
The possibilty to define a textual syntax for HxS in Xtext 2.0 and to generate an Eclipse-based editor for it, opened up new unbelievable possibilities for the HxS community. 
The HxS community decided to develop a new textual frontend for HxS based on Xtext 2.0. This became the sole interface from the end of 2011 onwards.
